Machine Learning Models File

This file serves as a central repository for managing and documenting your machine learning (ML) models, datasets, and workflows. Below is a structured guide to help you understand and use this file effectively.

Purpose

This file is designed to:

Provide a consistent framework for training, evaluating, and saving ML models.

Maintain a record of preprocessing steps, feature engineering, and model configurations.

Serve as a reference for reproducibility and collaboration across projects.

Contents

Datasets

Includes references to training, validation, and test datasets.

Provides details about preprocessing, feature engineering, and handling of missing values.

Models

Contains trained ML models for classification, regression, or clustering tasks.

Supports model versioning for experimentation and deployment purposes.

Key Features

Feature importance visualizations to understand model behavior.

Hyperparameter tuning configurations.

Validation metrics for performance assessment.

Dependencies

Python packages and versions required to run the models.

Environmental setups like GPU/CPU requirements, if applicable.
